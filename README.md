## Technologies Used

### React

At the heart of this project lies React, a JavaScript library renowned for its ability to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With React's component-based architecture, building reusable UI elements becomes a breeze. Whether it's displaying property listings, interactive maps, or dynamic search features, React empowers developers to craft rich and engaging web experiences.

### Vite

Driving the development workflow is Vite, a lightning-fast build tool tailored for modern web development. With Vite, the development experience is streamlined, thanks to features like instant server start and blazing-fast hot module replacement. Say goodbye to sluggish builds and hello to rapid iteration cycles, as Vite optimizes your project for speed and efficiency.

### CSS

Complementing the functionality of React is CSS, the language of web styling. With CSS, we bring life to our designs, shaping the visual identity of the real estate website. From defining layout structures to adding eye-catching animations, CSS empowers us to create visually stunning interfaces that captivate users and enhance their browsing experience.
